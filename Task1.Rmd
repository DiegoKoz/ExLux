## absolute number of articles for the given year

### Counting criteria

_first author counting_ considers only the first author of each publication. This means that each publication is considered only once. _whole counting_ give one credit to every author of each publication. This means that each publication is consider as many times as authors has. _whole-normalized counting_ consider all authors but distributes one credit between them equally distributed. This means that all the authors are consider but each publication is considered as one credit. Finally, _complete-normalized counting_ consider all authors and distributes one credit per publication, but in an unequally distributed way.

Given that the goal of the task is to count how many articles where published for Germany in 2010 for STEM, I consider that the _first author counting_ is the best criteria. The final count of the _whole-normalized counting_ and the _complete-normalized counting_ would give the same result. _whole counting_ is not useful as it would inflate the result we are interested in.


I remove the duplicated rows by `ut`.
```{r}
data %>% 
  distinct(ut,.keep_all = T) %>% 
  nrow(.)
```



## clean and re-code the variable “organization”

e.g. “Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin” = “HU” = “HU Berlin” = “Humboldt Uni”


first, to identify all articles which have at least one author who is affiliated to a university I need to remove those rows where no organization is defined.
```{r}
data_clean <- data %>% filter(!is.na(organization))
```

then, I remove all numbers, punctuation marks, accents. For this, I will define a cleaning function first.
```{r}

text_cleaner <- function(x){
  #replace numbers
  x <-  stringr::str_replace_all(x, stringr::regex("[0-9]*"),"")
  #replace replace punctuation
  x <- stringr::str_replace_all(x,stringr::regex("(\\+|\\-|\\=|\\:|;|\\.|,|_|\\?|¿|\\!|¡|\\\\|\\(|\\)|\\||\\^|\\>|\\<|\\/|#|\\$|%|&|\"|\\*|\\{|\\}|`|\\[|´|\\]|@|¨|°|ª)"),"")
  #replace repeted line breaks and carriage returns
  x <- stringr::str_replace_all(x,'(\r\n)|(\n\r)','\n') %>%
    stringr::str_replace_all('\n+','\n') %>%
    stringr::str_replace_all('\r+','\r') %>%
    stringr::str_replace_all('(\r\n)|(\n\r)','\n') %>%
    stringr::str_replace_all('\n+','\n')
  #to lowercase
  x <- str_to_lower(x)
  #remove accents
  x <- stringi::stri_trans_general(x,"Latin-ASCII")
  return(x)
}

data_clean <- data_clean %>% 
  mutate(organization_clean =text_cleaner(organization) ) %>% 
  select(organization_clean,organization, everything())
```

After this, I need to find if their organization is a university or a private institution.
A brief inspection of the dataset shows that the keyword for universities is _'univ'_. I filter the results that contain 'univ' as part of the organization name (after cleaning)

```{r}
data_clean <- data_clean %>% 
  filter(str_detect(organization_clean, "univ")) 
```

In order to address the problem of multiple names, I summarize the information by suborganization and city

```{r}
data_clean_summary <- data_clean %>% 
  filter(!is.na(suborganizations)) %>%
  group_by(suborganizations,city) %>% 
  summarise(len_org = length(unique(organization)),
            orgs = paste0(unique(organization_clean), collapse = '  | ')) %>% 
  arrange(-len_org)

data_clean_summary
```


```{r}
(data_clean_summary %>% filter(len_org==1) %>% nrow)/(data_clean_summary %>% nrow)

```

For the majority of the dataset (91% of the suborganization & city pairs) have one Organization per suborganization & city. 

for the rest of the dataset where the suborganization is defined, the organization's names only repeat few times and by a brief inspection, they all refer to the same institution. This means, the couple suborganization & city can be used for unifying the organization name field ^[note: for a real workflow situation a much more careful analysis should be made in order to avoid unifying different organizations]




```{r}
data_clean %>% 
  filter(is.na(suborganizations)) %>%
  group_by(suborganizations,city) %>% 
  summarise(len_org = length(unique(organization)),
            orgs = paste0(unique(organization_clean), collapse = '  | ')) %>% 
  arrange(-len_org)
```

When we analyse the data with no suborganizations, we found much more repetition by city and it is not clear that they all belong to the same organization.


### unification of the organization label

The proposed workflow is the following:

1. For the data with suborganization & city: count the number of times each organization name is used. When there is a tie, I will choose the shortest one
2. Define a codebook which associates the most used name with the others.
3. recode the names based on the codebook


```{r}
selected_names <- data_clean %>% 
  # keep only data with suborganization name
  filter(!is.na(suborganizations)) %>%
  # count repetition 
  group_by(suborganizations,city,organization_clean) %>% 
  summarise(n=n()) %>% 
  #define the most used and if it is the shortest
  group_by(suborganizations,city) %>% 
  mutate(organization_clean = organization_clean,
         max_n= max(n),
         name_length = nchar(organization_clean),
         is_shortest = name_length == min(name_length)) %>% 
  # final filter
  filter(n==max_n, is_shortest) %>% 
  #keep only usefull columns
  select(suborganizations,city, organization_new = organization_clean)



```


```{r}
# join the selected names with the original names by city and suborganization
codebook <- selected_names %>% 
 left_join(.,data_clean %>% 
  select(suborganizations,city, organization)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  distinct(organization, .keep_all = T) %>% 
  select(organization, organization_new)

codebook
```

I need to add those organizations that don't appear in the codebook (i.e., don't hace suborganization)

```{r}
codebook_apendix <- data_clean %>% select(-organization_new) %>% 
  left_join(codebook) %>% 
  filter(is.na(organization_new)) %>% 
  mutate(organization_new = organization_clean) %>% 
  distinct(organization, .keep_all = T) %>% 
  select(organization, organization_new) 

codebook <- bind_rows(codebook, codebook_apendix)
```


The final clean is to unify the use of words

- remove 'univ' and derivatives from the text and re-add it at the end (normalized way) in order to recongnize they are from universities
- normalize the derivatives of klinikum
- final adjustments of other variations


```{r}
glue::glue('before extra cleaning')
glue::glue('organization names: {length(unique(codebook$organization))}')
glue::glue('new names: {length(unique(codebook$organization_new))}')

codebook <- codebook %>% 
  mutate(organization_new = str_replace_all(organization_new, 'univ|universitat',''),
         organization_new = str_trim(organization_new),
         organization_new = str_replace_all(organization_new, '\\s+',' '),
         organization_new = paste0(organization_new, ' univ'))


#search derivatives of klinikum
glue('klinikum derivatives')
word(codebook$organization_new %>% str_extract("\\b[k|c]lin.*\\w")) %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  unique(.)

codebook2 <- codebook %>% 
   mutate(organization_new = str_replace(organization_new, "clin|klinikum|klinikums|kliniken|kliniku|klinkum ",' klin '),
          organization_new = str_replace(organization_new, " maximilian | maximilians | maximillian | maximillians ",' maximilian '),
          organization_new = str_replace(organization_new, "mus | music ",' music '),
          organization_new = str_trim(organization_new),
          organization_new = str_replace_all(organization_new, '\\s+',' '),)


glue::glue('after extra cleaning')
glue::glue('new names: {length(unique(codebook$organization_new))}')
```


The number of organizations names is reduced in 437

recode the original data

```{r}
data_clean <- data_clean %>% select(-organization_new) %>% 
  left_join(codebook)
data_clean
```

save the results

```{r}
data_clean %>% 
  write_delim(.,'results/task1-Dusdal_file4_MergedData_2010_20170316_CANDIDATES_results.txt')

codebook %>% 
  write_delim(.,'results/codebook_task1.txt')
```



# Final notes

### Program choice

I decided to use R as it allows to use powerfull libraries for Text Mining, and hence for the normalization process, and also embed the documentation in the code.
